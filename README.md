Welcome to my portfolio of computer vision projects, created as part of the **OpenCV course** at **OpenCV University**. This repository reflects weeks of dedicated learning, exploration, and experimentation with one of the most powerful libraries in computer vision.

## 📚 Course Overview

The **OpenCV University course** provided in-depth training in the fundamentals and advanced applications of OpenCV, including:

* Image Processing
* Object Detection & Tracking
* Face & Feature Recognition
* Image Segmentation
* Augmented Reality techniques

After completing the course, I extended my learning through hands-on practice and real-world project development.

## 🔍 What This Repo Contains

This repository documents the results of my journey, including a range of projects and experiments:

### 🔧 Key Projects:

* **Face Detection & Recognition** – Real-time recognition with Haar cascades and deep learning.
* **Color & Shape Detection** – Identify geometric shapes and dominant colors in any image.
* **Edge & Contour Mapping** – Advanced edge detection with Canny, Sobel, and Laplacian filters.
* **AR Marker Tracking** – Overlay virtual graphics on physical markers using homography.
* **Background Removal** – Extract people from frames with segmentation techniques.

Each project includes a detailed explanation, source code, and visual results.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* OpenCV (cv2)
* NumPy & Matplotlib
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebooks / PyCharm IDE
* Webcam / image feed processing

## 🧠 My Learning Process

This wasn’t just a technical journey—it was a creative and intellectual challenge. Along the way, I learned to:

* **Think visually**: Understand images as data and manipulate them meaningfully.
* **Debug creatively**: Resolve unexpected results in image processing pipelines.
* **Build modular solutions**: Design reusable, efficient code across projects.

> Every line of code here represents a small victory on the path to mastering computer vision.
